- This Project utilizes the **OpenWeather API** to fetch and retrieve real-time weather data of some limited locations of the world and display it in the UI.
- The App starts with a simple Splash Screen that has an svg image in the center.
- It then navigates to the main screen where the deafault weather data of Islamabad is shown.
- The background Scaffold color and the center image of sun, clouds, rainy clouds etc. updates based on the current weather condition of the specific city.
- The down arrow Icon infront of the city name gives a Popup Menu Option to users to select some limited cities of the world and view thier real time weather updates.
